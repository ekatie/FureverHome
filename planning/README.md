A web application for animal rescues to automate the adoption application process, including scheduling interviews, meet and greets and adoption day, as well as signing adoption contracts and receiving payment for adoption fees.

Potential adopters are able to browse available dogs, submit and track their application, and schedule their interview, meet and greet, and adoption date through the app. They can receive notifications when the next step is available.
